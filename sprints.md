# Project Sprint Plan - [Mobo]

---

## Project Overview
- **Project Name:** [Mobo]
- **Start Date:** [Sep 8]
- **End Date:** [Nov 9]
- **Project Goal:** [Gym progress tracker and AI powered workout suggestions]

# High-Level Sprint Planning

### Plan the Core Architecture:
- Design the app in a modular way with REST APIs, so the backend (Spring Boot) can handle all business logic, while the front-end (mobile or web) communicates via APIs.
- Use Spring Security for user authentication and role-based access (e.g., admin for managing exercises).

### Set Up a Reliable Database:
- Use Spring Data JPA for relational databases or Spring Data MongoDB for NoSQL databases. Ensure the user, workout, exercise, and progress data are efficiently stored.
- Build out the database schema first, allowing for flexibility in expanding features (e.g., adding nutrition tracking later).

### Create a Fluid and Intuitive UI:
- Ensure the user interface is intuitive, especially for logging workouts and tracking progress.
- Use front-end frameworks like React.js or Angular for dynamic, responsive UIs.

### Test with Real Users:
- Collect feedback from gym-goers, fitness enthusiasts, or personal trainers to improve usability and features.
- Perform user testing with different fitness levels to ensure the app caters to both beginners and experienced users.
